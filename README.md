# AndroidApplet  

Welcome to AndroidApplet repository. Here I have uploaded some basic Android Applets which helped me familiarize myself with various aspects of desigining a mobile app. 

### **Brief Description:**  

- **JumbleApp**<sup>*</sup>: this app takes as input a jumbled word and unscrambles it. That is, it provides all words (from a given dictionary) that can be made using *all* the letters in the input. Using an MVC model, I implemented the model and the control.

- **PhotoEdit**<sup>*</sup>: this app reflexts and rotates a photo taken within the app itself. Using an MVC model I implemented all three letters.

- **TipCalculator**<sup>*</sup>: this app calculates tip based on desired percentage and of course the total amount of the bill. Using an MVC model I implemented all three letters.

- **Note***: App ideas and description belong to the  EECS1022 course which I took in summer 2017, which you can check out  [here](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/course_archive/2016-17/S/1022/syllabus.html "EECS1022 Summer2017").
